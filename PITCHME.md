## The plan:

* Give a brief overview on what versioning is
* Set up Git on your machine
* Create a Repository
* Tracking Changes; or **add**, **commit**, **log**
* Recover old Changes
* Collaborating
* Conflicts
* Let's collab and put some points on a map! ðŸ—º

# Setup

### Step 1: Get Wifi!

# Setup

### Step 2: Get Git and a Github Account!

## Initializing a Repos

#### To initialize a repo:
1. Navagate to the programming directory:
  For PC Users: Go to ```C:\``` directory, then
  ```
  mkdir git-intro
  ```
  For Mac/Linux: ```cd ~/```, then
  ```
  mkdir git-intro
  ```
 2. Initialize a repo by typing in
 ```
 git init
 ```

### Git status
```git status``` shows the status of your repo including changes that are staged, or unstaged.

## Commiting to a Changes
Once you've made a file with a few lines:

1. *Stage it*:
```
git add <filename>
```
  - or
```
git add .```

2. *Commit it*:
 ```
 git commit -m <message>
 ```

#HSLIDE

### Where do the old versions go?

#HSLIDE

There are also circumstances where you want to revert your saving to the last commit. There are two commands which you should only use if you really need to. They are as follows:

```
git reset --hard HEAD
git checkout -- <filename>
```

**BEWARE...**

#HSLIDE

## Logs and Diffs

* If you wish to track the commits in a branch:
```
git log
```

 **git diff** shows the difference between what you've saved and the last commit. It can also show differences between other things, too!

### Branches

```
git checkout master
```
* Switch back to new branch:
```
git checkout new-branch
```

#HSLIDE

### Merge

* Go to the destination branch
* Merge in the source branch:
```
git merge new-branch
```
